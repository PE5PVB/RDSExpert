# RDSExpert Changelog

### --- 05/03/2026 ---
- Added a tooltip displaying the time difference (Time Offset) on the "Local CT" field, relative to UTC time.
- Added channels display in the IH (In House Applications) history, from 0 to 31.
- Added channels display in the TDC (Transparent Data Channels) history, from 0 to 31.
- Added display of "non-standard" PIN data. Some stations incorrectly send PIN data with "0" as day value. Until now, the PIN data was not decoded in such situation.
- Added Enhanced Radiotext decoding, with eRT+ tags. This advanced Radiotext feature, which is rarely used, allows, among other things, the display of non-Latin characters (such as Arabic or Greek). The decoding history is available by clicking on the new "eRT" indicator when such data is detected (requires sending the ODA indication dedicated to this use on group 3A).
- Added Radio Paging decoding on group 7A. It can be accessed by clicking on the new "RP" indicator when data is detected. The decoder is capable of intelligently detecting the type of messages sent. It can distinguish between a numeric or alphanumeric message, for example.
- Added Raw Data recording. This allows to record all RDS groups during decoding and export them in ASCII format. This recording can then be played back on RDSExpert or any other tool that supports playback of ASCII format recordings.
- Added Raw Data playback. It allows to play recordings in ASCII format, in order to view RDS decoding as on a signal received in real time. Recordings from other tools (such as RDS Spy, for example) are supported.
- Added Slow Labelling Codes (SLC) indicators to the Groups Monitor. This information is sent on group 1A and indicates, for example, the presence of an Extended Country Code.

### --- 28/02/2026 ---
- Added a 3 seconds delay for the In House Applications and TDC detection, in order to prevent false identifications. The indicators could light up incorrectly if groups 5A/5B and 6A/6B were used for another purpose.
- Added a new value to the LIC list (Language codes): LIC 40 -> "Clean feed".
- Added LW/MW frequencies recognition in the Method A AF lists. When found, they are displayed in purple boxes.
- Added recognition of the version used by the user (HTTP or HTTPS) to ensure that the information window regarding the inability to use an HTTP server on the HTTPS interface is not displayed when the HTTP version is used. A button has also been added to the HTTPS version modal, allowing immediate connection to the HTTP server via the version hosted by @Bkram (Opens in a new tab).
- Disabled Radiotext+ decoding if the RT+ ODA points to a B group, since it is technically impossible to encode Radiotext+ outside of A groups.
- Fixed a bug in the Long PS field that caused incorrect display during progressive decoding of Cyrillic characters until decoding was complete.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Radiotext+ detection and decoding on groups 5A/5B and 6A/6B, following the addition of TDC and In House Applications data decoding.
- In the plugin version, the "IH" indicator is now located between "TMC" and "TDC" to avoid confusion between these two indicators.
- The display of RDS groups content has been revised in the “Groups Monitor” section to make it clearer and more detailed.

### --- 27/02/2026 ---
- Corrected and refined some group descriptions.

### --- 25/02/2026 ---
- Added In-House Applications decoding. There is now an "IH" indicator: It lights up when such data is detected. To click on it will allow the user to view the data sent on groups 6A and 6B. An intelligent mechanism verifies whether groups 6A and 6B are actually used for sending In-House data or for an ODA.
- Added TDC (Transparent Data Channel) decoding. There is now a "TDC" indicator: It lights up when such data is detected. To click on it will allow the user to view the data sent on groups 5A and 5B. An intelligent mechanism verifies whether groups 5A and 5B are actually used for sending TDC data or for an ODA.
- Fixed special characters display in the groups monitor (More precisely in the Groups Content viewer). Some letters specific to certain languages were incorrectly displayed.

### --- 22/02/2026 ---
- Added TMC Map feature thanks to the contribution of Sjef Verhoeven (@PE5PVB). A major thanks to him for his work!

### --- 17/02/2026 ---
- Added "EWS ID" into the description of group 1A in the Groups Monitor and the PDF + TXT exports.
- Added identification for factory PI 3180 (PCS Electronics).
- Added new factory PI codes for PCS Electronics: A1B8 and C080.
  
### --- 16/02/2026 ---
- Added EWS (Emergency Warning System) indicator. The new box lights up if the station sends an EWS indication on group 1A, and the 2-character ID appears. Alerts details are not supported and displayed, the official documentation on the subject is, unfortunately, relatively low.
- Added factory PI codes detection and identification. When a factory code is detected, the "PI" field becomes red. Details about who uses this code are visible as a tooltip when the user puts the mouse cursor on the PI field. The values in database are based on RDS encoders manuals, personal knowledge and kind contributions from people who are into radio engineering.
- Added frequencies counter for AF Method A.
- Added PI to Callsign converter (for USA) as a tooltip. It appears when the user puts the mouse cursor on a PI value, if valid for such conversion.
- PS underscores reduced for stations using 2B group for the Radiotext, since 2B only allows 32 characters text. When underscores are enabled on RT, they will stop at the 32nd character. The underscores rule remains the same for stations using 2A for RT.
- Underscores are now removed on Long PS and RT once a <0D> code is detected. They are still visible on the "Progressive underscores on RT" mode.
- Underscores are now removed on Long PS when the decoded RDS doesn't include this function (via group 15A).

### --- 15/02/2026 ---
- TMC decoder: Fixed a bug in the Provider Name display.

### --- 14/02/2026 ---
- Added a tooltip to each RT line to indicate the maximum number of characters that can be sent depending on the group used, 2A or 2B ("32 char." / "64 char.")
- Added an "information" icon. Clicking it will redirect the user to the decoder's documentation on GitHub (Wiki) via a new tab.
- Added EID and Channel info in the ODA's section of the PDF/TXT exports when the DAB Cross-Referencing ODA is detected.
- Added Radiotext technical codes (e.g. <0D>) to the Radiotext history on the interface and in the TXT export.
- Added user's preferences storage in the web browser (using localStorage). For example, if the user enables underscores on PS/RT, they will appear at the next session.
- Bandscan export: Added a delay of 2 seconds before an RDS is considered as "storable" to prevent RDS data from being logged for a previous frequency.
- Detailed data/Bandscan export: Added empty Radiotext recognition. If a station doesn't send text but a technical code such as <0D>, the RT will be displayed as is.
- Empty PS messages are now detected and stored in the PS history.
- Fixed missing ECC recognition for Finland (6xxx > E1).
- TMC decoder: Added provider name, decoded from Group 8A.

### --- 11/02/2026 ---
- Added TP, TA and PTY values to the PDF's EON section, in addition to the AF and Mapped Frequencies that were already included.
- Added an error message if the webserver API cannot be contacted when starting a bandscan.
- Radiotext codes (e.g. <0D>) are now displayed in the PDF exports.

### --- 01/02/2026 ---
- Bandscan/Detailed data export: Added dBf to dBuV conversion in the export-preview modal.
- Bandscan/Detailed data export: Added dynamic PS messages display in the main PS field, limited to 14 messages.
- Bandscan/Detailed data export: Added purple color to the PS field for stations using a dynamic PS in the stations/signals summary.
- Calls to the webservers API have been strengthened. New calls are attempted every 5 seconds if the first one is unsuccessful.
- Improved the PS history to reduce decoding errors.

### --- 29/01/2026 ---
- Added bandscan and detailed reports function with TXT and PDF export.

### --- 13/01/2026 ---

- Added new underscores option: "Progressive underscores on RT".
- The values in the PS/PTY/PTYN history are now separated.

### --- 04/01/2026 ---
- Added a function to show spaces as underscores in the PS history.
- Improved data export to text. Output is now smoother and includes more information.
- Improved the mapped frequencies display in the EON section. 10 frequencies can be displayed now, instead of 4.
- Removed RDS/RBDS button. Both PTY versions are now displayed in the field, separated by a vertical line.

### --- 03/01/2026 ---
- Changed the BER indicator behavior: It will now appear after 3 seconds to prevent the display of incorrect values, waiting for the RDS websocket to stabilize itself.

### --- 31/12/2025 ---
- Added automatic RDS data reset on frequency change.
